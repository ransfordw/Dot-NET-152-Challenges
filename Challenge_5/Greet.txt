Email Problem

Komodo Insurance is trying to send an email to everyone in the world, and they have lost
their customer database. 

They want to share some of their great deals with current, past, and potential customers.  

For their current customers, they want to send an appreciation email, something that says this:
"Thank you for your work with us. We appreciate your loyalty. Here's a coupon."

For past customers, they want to send a note that says something like this:
"It's been a long time since we've heard from you, we want you back".

For potential customers who have never worked with Komodo, they want to send an email
that simply states what deals Komodo is currently offering. It would be something like this:
"We currently have the lowest rates on Helicopter Insurance!"

Along with defining the proper class for a customer, your task will be to make 
an application that allows administrators to create, delete, update, and read
details about individual customers. 

You will also need a method that takes in a customer object and pretends to send the 
proper email message based on the customer type. 

Be sure to Unit Test your Repository methods.

Out of scope: Actually sending an email. We are just creating the string for the email.

The admin needs to be able to add customers and view a list of customers with the 
output being the following:
