Komodo Insurance is fixing their badging system. 

Here's what they need:

An app that maintains a dictionary of details about employee badge information.
Essentially, an employee will have a badge number that gives access to a list of doors.
Each employee has access to different doors. For instance, a developer might have 
access to Door A1 & A5. A claims agent might have access to B2 & B4.

Your task will be to create the following:
A badge class that has the following properties:
	BadgeID
	List of door names for access

A badge repository that will have methods that do the following:
1. Create a dictionary of badges. 
2. The key for the dictionary will be the BadgeID.
3. The value for the dictionary will be the List of Door Names.

The Program will allow a security staff member to do the following:
create a new badge.
update doors on an existing badge.
delete all doors from an existing badge.
show a list with all badge numbers and door access, like this:

Key
Badge #			 Door Access       
1				 a1, a5, d4			 
2				 a1, a4, b1, b2		 
3				 a4, a5				

Out of scope:
You do not need to consider tying an individual badge to a particular user. Just the Badge # will do.

Be sure to Unit Test your Repository methods.
